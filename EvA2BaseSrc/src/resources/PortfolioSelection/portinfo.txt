There are currently 5 data files.

These data files are the test problems used in the working paper:
"Heuristics for cardinality constrained portfolio optimisation"
by T.-J. Chang, N. Meade, J.E. Beasley and Y.M. Sharaiha
available from J.E. Beasley at
The Management School, Imperial College, London SW7 2AZ,
England

The test problems are the files:
port1, port2, ..., port5

The format of these data files is:
number of assets (N)
for each asset i (i=1,...,N):
   mean return, standard deviation of return
for all possible pairs of assets:
   i, j, correlation between asset i and asset j

The unconstrained efficient frontiers for each of these
data sets are available in the files:
portef1, portef2, ..., portef5

The format of these files is:
for each of the calculated points on the unconstrained frontier:
   mean return, variance of return


The largest file is port5 of size 400Kb (approximately)
The entire set of files is of size 950Kb (approximately).
